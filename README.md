# CatMash

Java/angular application to vote for the cutest cat

To run the app you can use docker or manual run.

For Docker, u need to have Docker installed on ur computer and in the current folder run:

```bash
docker build - t catmash -p 8081:8081 .
```
This will create a container with catmash image

Do the same for the frontend app, the app will be available on:

`localhost:8081/api/v1`

For manual run open the project in ur favorite editor and run as a SpringBoot Application
